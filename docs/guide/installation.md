* Use the 'Run Script' menu (located in the Test tab) to locate and run this script.
* Follow the installer's instructions to put Roact into `ReplicatedStorage`

### Method 2: Rojo

* Put Roact into your project:
	* Copy the `lib` folder into your project, and rename it to `Roact`
	* Alternatively, add a Git submodule to your project
* Add a partition in Rojo to put Roact into `ReplicatedStorage.Roact`
