Roact is a *declarative* Lua UI library similar to Facebook's React. It exposes a very similar API and implements nearly identical semantics.

This documentation assumes some familiarity with Lua. If you're new to Lua, [*Programming in Lua* by Roberto Ierusalimschy](https://www.lua.org/pil/) is a good introduction, and the first edition (for Lua 5.0) is available online for free.

The Roact docs are still a work in progress -- if you find any typos or issues, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Roblox/roact/issues)!
