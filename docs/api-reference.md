# Roact API Reference

## Component Types

### Roact.Component
The base component instance that can be extended to make stateful components.

Call `Roact.Component:extend("ComponentName")` to make a new stateful component with a given name.

### Roact.PureComponent
An extension of `Roact.Component` that only re-renders if its props or state change.

`PureComponent` implements the `shouldUpdate` lifecycle event with a shallow equality comparison. It's optimized for use with immutable data structures, which makes it a perfect fit for use with frameworks like Rodux.

`PureComponent` is not *always* faster, but can often result in significant performance improvements when used correctly.

### Roact.Portal
A component that represents a *portal* to a Roblox Instance. Portals are created using `Roact.createElement`.

Any children of a portal are put inside the Roblox Instance specified by the required `target` prop. That Roblox Instance should not be one created by Roact.

Portals are useful for creating dialogs managed by deeply-nested UI components, and enable Roact to represent and manage multiple disjoint trees at once.

See [the Portals guide](/advanced/portals.md) for a small tutorial and more details about portals.

## Component API

### init
```
init(initialProps) -> void
```

`init` is called exactly once when a new instance of a component is created. It can be used to set up the initial `state`, as well as any non-`render` related values directly on the component.

`init` is the only place where you can assign to `state` directly, as opposed to using `setState`:

```lua
function MyComponent:init()
	self.state = {
		position = 0,
		velocity = 10
	}
end
```

### render
```
render() -> Element | nil
```

`render` describes what a component should display at the current instant in time.

!!! info
	Roact assumes that `render` act likes a pure function: the result of `render` must depend only on `props` and `state`, and it must not have side-effects.

```lua
function MyComponent:render()
	-- This is okay:
	return Roact.createElement("TextLabel", {
		Text = self.props.text,
		Position = self.state.position
	})

	-- Ack! Depending on values outside props/state is not allowed!
	return Roact.createElement("TextLabel", {
		Text = self.someText,
		Position = getMousePosition(),
	})
end
```

`render` must be defined for all components. The default implementation of `render` throws an error; if your component does not render anything, define a render function that returns `nil` explicitly.

```lua
function MyComponent:render()
	return nil
end
```

### setState
```
setState(newState) -> void
```

`setState` merges a table of new state values (`newState`) onto the existing `state` and re-renders the component if necessary. Existing values are not affected.

```lua
function MyComponent:didMount()
	self:setState({
		foo = "bar"
	})
end
```

!!! warning
	Calling `setState` from any of these places is not allowed and will throw an error:

	* Lifecycle hooks: `willUpdate`, `willUnmount`
	* Initialization: `init`
	* Pure functions: `render`, `shouldUpdate`

!!! info "Future API Changes"
	Depending on current `state` in `setState` may cause subtle bugs when Roact starts supporting [asynchronous rendering](https://github.com/Roblox/roact/issues/18).

	A new API similar to React [is being introduced](https://github.com/Roblox/roact/issues/33) to solve this problem. This documentation will be updated when that API is released.

### shouldUpdate
```
shouldUpdate(nextProps, nextState) -> bool
```

`shouldUpdate` provides a way to override Roact's rerendering heuristics.

Right now, components are re-rendered any time a parent component updates, or when state is updated via `setState`.

`PureComponent` implements `shouldUpdate` to only trigger a re-render any time the props are different based on shallow equality. In a future Roact update, *all* components may implement this check by default.

## Lifecycle Events
Roact exposes a number of events that stateful components can hook into to be notified of various steps in the rendering process.

Mounting:

<div class="component-diagram" aria-role="presentation">
	<span class="component-diagram-box">init</span>
	<span class="component-diagram-arrow">➝</span>
	<span class="component-diagram-box">render</span>
	<span class="component-diagram-arrow">➝</span>
	<span class="component-diagram-box">didMount</span>
</div>

Updating:

<div class="component-diagram" aria-role="presentation">
	<span class="component-diagram-box">shouldUpdate?</span>
	<span class="component-diagram-arrow">➝</span>
	<span class="component-diagram-box">willUpdate</span>
	<span class="component-diagram-arrow">➝</span>
	<span class="component-diagram-box">render</span>
	<span class="component-diagram-arrow">➝</span>
	<span class="component-diagram-box">didUpdate</span>
</div>

Unmounting:

<div class="component-diagram" aria-role="presentation">
	<span class="component-diagram-box">willUnmount</span>
</div>

### didMount
```
didMount() -> void
```

`didMount` is fired after the component finishes its initial render. At this point, all associated Roblox Instances have been created, and all components have finished mounting.

`didMount` is a good place to start initial network communications, attach events to services, or modify the Roblox Instance hierarchy.

### willUnmount
```
willUnmount() -> void
```

`willUnmount` is fired right before Roact begins tearing down a component instance's children.

`willUnmount` acts like a component's destructor, and is a good place to disconnect any manually-connected events.

### willUpdate
```
willUpdate(nextProps, nextState) -> void
```

`willUpdate` is fired after an update is started but before a component's state and props are updated.

### didUpdate
```
didUpdate(previousProps, previousState) -> void
```

`didUpdate` is fired after at the end of an update. At this point, the reconciler has updated the properties of any Roblox Instances and the component instance's props and state are up to date.

`didUpdate` is a good place to send network requests or dispatch Rodux actions, but make sure to compare `self.props` and `self.state` with `previousProps` and `previousState` to avoid triggering too many updates.

## Constants

### Roact.Children
This is the key that Roact uses internally to store the children that are attached to a Roact element.

If you're writing a new functional or stateful element that needs to be used like a primitive component, you can access `Roact.Children` in your props table.

### Roact.Ref
Used to access underlying Roblox instances. See [the refs guide](/advanced/refs.html) for more details.

### Roact.Event
Index into this object to get handles that can be used for attaching events to Roblox objects. See [the events guide](/guide/events.md) for more details.

## Methods

### Roact.createElement
```
Roact.createElement(component, [props, [children]]) -> RoactElement
```

Creates a new Roact element representing the given `component`.

The `children` argument is shorthand for adding a `Roact.Children` key to `props`. It should be specified as a dictionary of names to elements.

`component` can be a string, a function, or a table created by `Component:extend`.

!!! caution
	Once `props` or `children` are passed into the `createElement`, make sure not to modify them!

### Roact.reify
```
Roact.reify(element, [parent, [key]]) -> RoactComponentInstance
```

Creates a Roblox Instance given a Roact element, and optionally a `parent` to put it in, and a `key` to use as the instance's `Name`.

The result is a `RoactComponentInstance`, which is an opaque handle that represents this specific instance of the root component. You can pass this to APIs like `Roact.teardown` and the future debug API.

### Roact.teardown
```
Roact.teardown(instance) -> void
```

Destroys the given `RoactComponentInstance` and all of its descendents. Does not operate on a Roblox Instance -- this must be given a handle that was returned by `Roact.reify`.

### Roact.oneChild
`Roact.oneChild(children) -> RoactElement | nil`

Given a dictionary of children, returns a single child element.

If `children` contains more than one child, `oneChild` function will throw an error. This is intended to denote an error when using the component using `oneChild`.

If `children` is `nil` or contains no children, `oneChild` will return `nil`.

### Roact.isPrimitiveElement
```
Roact.isPrimitveElement(element) -> bool
```

Determines whether the given `element` is primtive. These elements are created with a string parameter to `createElement` and represent a Roblox instance.

### Roact.isFunctionalElement
```
Roact.isFunctionalElement(element) -> bool
```

Determines whether the given `element` is functional. These elements are created with a function parameter to `createElement` and represent a stateless Roact component.

### Roact.isStatefulElement
```
Roact.isStatefulElement(element) -> bool
```

Determines whether the given `element` is stateful. These elements are created with a table parameter to `createElement` and represent a *potentially* stateful Roact component.
